Wind energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to generate electricity.
Wind accounts for approximately 10% of global electricity production.
A wind turbine can generate up to 6 million kWh annually.
Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore have designed a low-cost wind harvester that can generate electricity at low wind speeds.
The harvester can generate up to 3 volts and 290 microwatts of electricity.
Aeromine Technologies has developed a novel bladeless wind energy technology compatible with domestic solar power and electricity systems.
SeaTwirl, a Swedish turbine company, deployed vertical-axis wind turbines with a tower coupled to a subsea construction comprised of a keel and floating element.
Scientists from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) are collaborating to construct 206-meter rotors for land-based turbines.
Wind Catching Systems (WCS) will commercialize its floating wind harvesting technology for offshore wind farms in collaboration with the institute of energy technology and the Norwegian energy service provider Aibel.
Global wind electricity production grew by a record 273 TWh in 2021.
To meet net zero by 2050, average annual capacity additions must be increased to almost 250 GW.
