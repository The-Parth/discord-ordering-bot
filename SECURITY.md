Vulnerabilities might influence anyone who uses this project and hence we expect your due deligence in reporting the problem as soon as you can.
However, we expect all reporters to follow a certain set of protocols before reporting an issue. 

1. You are free to open an issue reporting the security vulnerabilty and what happens due to it, but please report the steps to exploit, possible patches, vulnerable snippet directly to the repository maintainers.
2. This is not applicable for bugs in the project, only for security flaws.

This project is a trial project so not much more to say here.
